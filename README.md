# What's Beyond the Accuracy of Code Models?

This GitHub repository is dedicated to curating a comprehensive collection of publications that focus on various aspects of code models beyond their accuracies. While accuracy is undoubtedly an essential factor in evaluating code models, there is a growing need to explore other dimensions that contribute to a model's overall effectiveness and applicability.

The aim of this repository is to shine a light on research that delves into areas such as robustness, interpretability, fairness, and other important criteria that can help improve the state of code models. By compiling these publications, we hope to provide a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners in the field of code modeling.
